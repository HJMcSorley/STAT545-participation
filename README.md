# STAT545 Participation Repository
This is the participation repo for STAT 545, 2019/2020

This repo contains learning exercises carried out in class, which count towards 'participation' marks.

Each Class Meeting (cm) exercise is listes as cm00#, with the number indicating the class (e.g cm006 is the in-class exercise for meeting #6). Each exercise (.Rmd or .R) was pushed to GitHub following completion of the class.

___Exceptions in folder "weeks1+2":___ 
* no cm001 = "navigating_github.md"  
* cm002: the second class meeting created the [participation repo](https://hjmcsorley.github.io/STAT545-participation) 
* cm003 = "navigating_github.md" + "RMDexploration_slides.Rmd" + "RMDexploration.html" files files
* no cm004: the fourth class focused on understaning version control and did not generate an R file
