# STAT545 Participation Repository
This is the participation repo for STAT 545, 2019/2020

This repo contains learning exercises carried out in class, which count towards 'participation' marks.

Each Class Meeting (cm) exercise is listes as cm000#, with the number indicating the class (e.g cm0006 is the in-class exercise for meeting #6). Each exercise was pushed to GitHub following completion of the class.
